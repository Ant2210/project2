## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
2. At the top right hand corner of the screen click on your avatar and select 'Your repositories' from the dropdown menu
3. Select the repository you would like to deploy from your list of repositories
4. Near the top centre of the repository (not top of the page), locate and click the settings button on the menu
5. Locate the 'Pages' option on the left hand menu of the settings page
6. Ensure the 'Source' option says 'Deploy from a branch'
7. Under Branch' change the 'None' option to 'main' then press the 'Save' button to the right
8. Under branch it should now say "Your GitHub Pages site is currently being built from the main branch."
9. Wait a few minutes for the page to refresh (this can take up to 5 minutes but usually only 2-3 minutes)
10. You may have to refresh the page at this point, once completed at the top of the page you will see your site it live with the link to the live site. 
11. If you are unsure and want to check the progress you can click on 'Code' along the top menu of the setting (not top of the screen)
12. Under 'Environments' on the right hand side you will see github-pages
13. Clicking this link will tell you if your page is queue, in progress or active.

5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site link in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository
