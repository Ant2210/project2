## User Experience (UX) 

### User stories

#### First Time Visitor Goals

-  As a first time visitor, I want to find out find out what the quiz is about and how to play.
-  As a first time visitor, I want to be able to navigate the site quickly and easily, it should be intuitive and obvious what to do next.
-  As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to play the quiz any time and on any of my internet connected devices and therefore responsive. 
-  As a First Time Visitor, I want the quiz to be fun and inviting. 

#### Returning Visitor Goals

-  As a returning visitor, I want to be able to keep track of my previous scores so I can try and improve upon it. 
-  As a returning visitor, I want to be able to adjust the difficulty as my knowledge improves.
-  As a returning visitor, I don't want to answer the same questions over and over so as not to get board of the quiz too quickly.

#### Frequent User Goals
       
- A frequent users requirements would be much the same as a returning visitor given fairly basic nature of the quiz. A frequent user may however want to be able to compare scores with friends.

### Design
#### Colour Scheme
The main considerations for the colour scheme were aesthetics and accessibility. As this is a video game quiz I decided to go for a retro theme and the blue colour chosen is reminiscent of the rolling sky backgrounds found in a lot of retro games, which is then further complemented by the background image chosen.

When choosing the main text colour, I wanted a dark contrasting colour but didn't want to use black `#ffffff` as I found this to be quite harsh, so opted for a slightly softened black/grey colour.

I then used a colour picker to select a backup background colour the same colour as the sky in the background image. This however doesn't effect accessibility in any way as all text is overlaid within a "container" which is the main blue colour.

When Selecting the button colours I wanted something basic but vibrant that still sticks with the retro them but contrasts well against the blue colour. During the main quiz the buttons flash green for correct answers and red for incorrect answers which are fairly intuitive colours for this purpose.

  -   ##### Colours Used

        - Main colour theme - `#2290fd`
        - Text colour - `#161616`
        - Backup background colour - `#65D3F0`
        - Button colour - `#ffdf29`
        - Correct answer button colour - `#008000`
        - Incorrect answer button colour - `#ff0000`

#### Colour Accessibility
			
When deciding on the shade of blue and black to use, I used Coolors.co contract checker tool  which can be found [here](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/000000-ffffff), to ensure the colours chosen met the WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines as minimum and AAA guidelines where possible.<br>

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
2. At the top right hand corner of the screen click on your avatar and select 'Your repositories' from the dropdown menu
3. Select the repository you would like to deploy from your list of repositories
4. Near the top centre of the repository (not top of the page), locate and click the settings button on the menu
5. Locate the 'Pages' option on the left hand menu of the settings page
6. Ensure the 'Source' option says 'Deploy from a branch'
7. Under Branch' change the 'None' option to 'main' then press the 'Save' button to the right
8. Under branch it should now say "Your GitHub Pages site is currently being built from the main branch."
9. Wait a few minutes for the page to refresh (this can take up to 5 minutes but usually only 2-3 minutes)
10. You may have to refresh the page at this point, once completed at the top of the page you will see your site it live with the link to the live site. 
11. If you are unsure and want to check the progress you can click on 'Code' along the top menu of the setting (not top of the screen)
12. Under 'Environments' on the right hand side you will see github-pages
13. Clicking this link will tell you if your page is queue, in progress or active.

4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site link in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Login to GitHub
2. Locate the repository, you can use a link you have been provided with or use the search function in the top left of the screen
3. In the top right hand corner of the page locate and click the 'fork' button
4. Near the bottom of the page click the green button that says 'Create Fork'
5. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account

### Making a Local Clone

1. Login to GitHub
2. Locate the repository, you can use a link you have been provided with or use the search function in the top left of the screen
3. Near the top of the repository click the green 'Code' button
4. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under HTTPS copy the link provided
5. Open the terminal in your code editor 
6. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made
7. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3
8. Press Enter. Your local clone should be created
